## Objective of this Repo
Although many online well structured reosurces are available online, one of them are the reference and inspiration links given below, 

What I aim here is to mostly re-create (and add few of my own) solutions on how to approach a specific real world system design problem.

Here I aim to take a specific design problem and create my own solution based on my understanding and also point out to other viable approaches online if any.
